## Project Overview

Youngsters entering the voting population often struggle to engage in politics and make informed voting decisions due to a lack of time, resources, and motivation. Our mission with PolElec is to simplify the political analysis process both before and after voting, aiming to bridge the gap between the public and elected officials while promoting transparency in the democratic process.

### Problem Definition

**1. Lack of Youth Engagement in Politics**: Despite India being the world's largest democracy with a significant youth population, many young people show disinterest in politics. Even those interested often encounter conflicting and biased information, hindering their ability to make informed voting decisions.

**2. Lack of Transparency in Democracy**: Existing democratic systems have had a lack of transparency for far too long, breeding a culture of secrecy and corruption. There is no effective way to directly hold elected representatives accountable for their actions.

### Stakeholders and Their Roles

**Politicians**:
- Provide their agendas and promises (manifesto before election)
- Can take polls about policy decisions

**Young Voters**:
- Get a clear picture of the background of political leaders.
- Access information about candidates, including their criminal antecedents.
- Transparent tracking of election goals achieved/delayed/forgotten.
- Efficient sorting of news information.
- Communicate their grievances to their elected officials directly.

### Existing Challenges

- Lack of awareness among first-time voters.
- Widespread misinformation.
- Lack of a medium for two-way communication.
- Difficulty in filtering relevant news information.
- No effective way for citizens to participate in the decision-making process.

### Existing Solutions

Current solutions do not offer all the features presented in our solution. Often, they focus only on one aspect and neglect others.

Private solutions are often narrow in their focus and are limited by practical concerns such as funding. On an international scale, many startups have arisen to solve issues related to democracy, such as the Greek startup Novoville, which provides a communication medium between the public and government. Another startup, Polyteia, provides data analytics and visualization solutions. However, these platforms offer only one aspect of the solution and fail to solve the larger issues plaguing democratic institutions.

On a national level, there does not seem to be any unified interface providing a one-stop destination for democracy. The current solutions address the issues partially but fail to completely solve them. For example, Bolsubol only focuses on news and data but does not provide a medium of communication between elected officials and the public.

Existing government solutions are quite scattered and insufficient. The Election Commission has released a suite of more than 10 apps, which, despite being inclusive, are neglected and lack support. The reviews on these apps are negative, as these apps are filled with bugs and often crash. On top of that, they havenâ€™t been made with the consumer in mind. The implementation of these apps is severely lacking. Also, these are specific to the voting process, hence do not have features to hold the elected leaders accountable or a way to communicate with your local representatives.

### Our Solution: PolElec

Through PolElec, we aim to combine all the above requirements and more into one application. We aim to provide relevant, unbiased news specific to a locality, arming voters with all the necessary information to make their decision. We aim to provide a platform where a voter can find out all the necessary information about their local leaders as well as track the promises made during elections. We would have a ranking system that would rank local political leaders on different aspects based on universally accepted objective criteria. Renowned experts would have the power to directly contribute to the news information, and big media houses would be able to publish their articles after a propaganda filtration system.

Further, we provide transparent two-way communication between the voter and the politician. The voter can ask their representative questions and explain their issues. The politician also benefits from better communication with their constituents and they also have the ability to conduct polls about policy decisions. Since emails are often insufficient to reach even local representatives, we would have a chat system where relevant grievances can be filed and will be brought to the attention of local leaders. Other people can choose to agree with the grievance to add legitimacy to a concern raised.

Lastly, we aim to make a fair democracy accessible in any small-scale organization by providing a platform where polls can be conducted. For example, an institute may be able to conduct small student elections with ease. Also, the institute would be able to take feedback and make announcements. The local news filter could be used to make an institute-specific daily newspaper of sorts.
